#### About

`app.js` is where all the JavaScript logic for this web application is written. Here you can find all the event listeners and logic for selecting a random message which will be displayed to the user, as well as logic for the cursor follower. <br>
`style.css` is where all the CSS styling for the webpage is placed. This file give CSS attributes to all the elements on the HTML page to place them, shape them and decorate them as we wish. <br>
`index.html` is where the skeleton of our SPA is. We incorporated bootstrap into this file to create a modal, and we used the standard html tags to create the basic layout of our page.
